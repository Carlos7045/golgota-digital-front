# CRITICAL ADMIN FIX APPLIED

## Problem:
- Carlos Henrique receives roles: ['user'] instead of ['admin']
- Admin panel inaccessible due to role restriction
- Production deployment not picking up db-vercel.js changes

## Solution Applied:
- Hardcoded admin role in /api/profile endpoint
- Multiple verification methods: user.id, user.email, profile.email, profile.cpf
- Direct fix in main API route bypassing storage layer

## Expected Result:
- GET /api/profile should return roles: ['admin'] for Carlos Henrique
- Admin panel should become accessible immediately
- No more login loops

## Test Command:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://www.comandogolgota.com.br/api/profile" \
  -H "Cookie: your_session_cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "profile": {...},
  "roles": ["admin"]
}
```
